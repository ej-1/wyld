      Hello<%=  @recipient.name %>
    </p>

    <p>
      We'd like to personally invite you to check out our new WYLD platform designed to connect fashion bloggers like you with sponsors and designers planning fashion shows: wyld.events
    </p>

    <a href="http://www.wyld.events">wyld.events</a>

    <p>
      From 2017, we plan to livestream fashion shows through selected fashion bloggers channels and websites. Participating bloggers will also be invited to commentate at the fashion events for their online followers. We will personally invite companies to sponsor the fashion livestream and share the streaming sponsorship revenue with show planners and bloggers.
    </p>

    <p>
      We'd like to ask you register through our beta <a href="http://www.wyld.events/entrepreneur">site</a> if you'd consider livestreaming through the WYLD platform next year - and be financially rewarded for doing so. Naturally, you can email the team@wyld.events with any questions too.
