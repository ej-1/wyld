                            You should have already formed a following of at least 750 people to register with WYLD. You can be a v-logger, a host of a webzine or run an online fashion channel. After signing up, you'll be sent a link where you can enter details about the kind of fashion you cover. The info you provide will help us connect you to the kind of shows you'd most likely be interested in commentating and streaming from your channel, blog or site. If accepted into our pool of 'Streamers', you'll be invited to commentate live at the events we stream through your channel.

              <h4>During the evaluation, we classify your channel as a DÃ©butante, Independent or Major Streamer. This classification is based on your follower amount, among other factors. The biggest fashion shows that have the strongest online viewership potential will be awarded to Streamers with the largest follower count, meaning you'll be able to commentate live at the shows that reflect your work building a community. If you are just starting out but you've already carved a niche for yourself, you'll most likely be paired with shows held by up-and-coming labels and designers.

                Only when an event Planner and you as a Streamer have committed to livestreaming a fashion show do we notify our network of potential Sponsors that a show is coming up to be livestreamed. We notify potential Sponsors with curated details about your audience and the audience of the fashion show itself, aiming for a good match all round. Two kinds of livestreaming sponsorship packages will be available, Corporate and Main, to be made available to the highest bidding Sponsor. A portion of the sponsorship amount is then allocated to you after the successful livestreaming of a show. This tiered payment amount is based on your follower count and subsequently the show you stream. Full details of this payment structure will be made to successful applicants closer to our launch date.

You can also interview designers if they have time before or after the event. If you broadcast on a platform like Youtube that requires a share of any product placement fees received, you will need to notify the channel that you are being sponsored for the stream and on-camera work. Note that we only work with event organisers who have secured the online streaming rights to any music played at the show, so you don't need to worry about infringing anyone's IP.</h4>
