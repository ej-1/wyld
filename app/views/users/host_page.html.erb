                              - How long you have been on the market. If you are just starting out, we suggest you co-organise your event with other designers as a collective show
                               <br>
                              - Other factors that will help us connect your show with the best-suited Streamer.

                               This info helps classify your show into 'DÃ©butante', 'Independent' or 'Major'. We then contact a Streamer with a similar amount of followers as yours or your collectives with the goal of at least doubling the total viewership for the event. For example, a fashion college's year-end show would be streamed and in most cases commentated by a Streamer with around 1000 followers. A larger collective or a more established designer's show with a combined following of 5000 would be hosted (and commentated) by a Streamer who also has around 5000 followers.  The classification system means small, medium and large Sponsors can find the ideal show to back.

Initially they will be invited to commentate at the show and conduct live interviews there too. In the future, we plan to include remote commentating for larger shows so that more than one Streamer can commentate in other languages.

Only two sponsorship packages will be available, Corporate and Main, to keep things exclusive. Packages are available on a highest bid basis.

Event Planners may also bring their own sponsors up to one week before the event. Here the streaming sponsorship fee will be decided on a case by case basis.</span>
