                              - other factors that will help us connect your show with the best 'Streamer', who is usually a blogger or webzine host with their own channel.

                               This info helps classify your show into 'Rookie', 'Independent' or 'Major'. We then contact a Streamer with a similar amount of followers as yours or your collectives with the goal of at least doubling the total viewership for the event. For example, a student graduate show would be streamed and in most cases commentated by a rookie Streamer with around 1000 followers. A larger collective or a more established designer's show with a combined following of 5000 will be hosted (and commentated) by an independent Streamer who also has around 5000 followers.  The classification system means small, medium and large firms can find the ideal show to sponsor.

Initially they will be invited to commentate at the show and conduct live interviews there too. In the future, we plan to include remote commentating for larger shows so that more than one Streamer can commentate in other languages.
