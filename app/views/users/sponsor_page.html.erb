                               This info helps classify us the applicant's show into 'DÃ©butante', 'Independent' or 'Major'. We then contact a Streamer with a similar amount of followers with the goal of at least doubling the total viewership for the event. For example, a fashion college graduate show would be streamed and in most cases commentated by a Streamer with around 1000 followers. A fashion collective or a more established designer's show with a combined following of 5000 will be broadcast by an independent Streamer with a similar number of followers.  The classification system means small, medium and large Sponsors can find the ideal show to back.

In the future, we plan to include remote commentating for larger shows so that more than one Streamer can commentate in other languages.

                Only when a Streamer is confirmed do we announce the event to be livestreamed to our network of Sponsors. Here we take the prefered demographic and audience size details supplied to us by Sponsors and attempt to match this with the most suitable Streamer and live event pairing. Only two packages will be available to keep sponsorship exclusive: Corporate and Main. Packages are available on a highest bid basis. We are working on determining the best possible deals for Sponsors, and welcome feedback and suggestions ahead of launch. This is the current Sponsor Package structure:

               Sponsorship payment is split following the show, with 25% going to the event planners and 75% to the WYLD platform, a portion of which is paid to the show's Streamer based on their follower count. Event planners may also bring their own sponsors up to one week before the event. Here the livestreaming sponsorship fee is usually reduced and decided on a case by case basis.</span>
